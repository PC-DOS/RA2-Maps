# Equipment is found in /Hearts of Iron IV/common/units/equipment/*.txt. Equipment is split into two types, archetype and regular. Archetype equipment is used to assign more general attributes that regular equipment then inherits via the archetype attribute.
# 
# Archetype equipment follows the following format:
# 
# equipments = {
# 	<equipment> = {
# 		year = <int>		# Limits the equipment from appearing before the specified year. Optional
# 		picture = <name>	# GFX reference used to define equipment picture in lend-lease
# 		
# 		can_be_produced = {	# Optional, specifies when equipment of this category can be produced.
# 			<triggers>
# 		}
# 		
# 		is_archetype = yes	# Specifies an entry as an archetype entry. All non-archetype entries inherit 
# 		is_buildable = no	# Prevents this equipment from being built.
# 		active = yes		# Determines if this equipment is available without unlocking from a technology.
# 		
# 		type = <type>	   	# Internal type: what kind of unit can use this equipment
# 
# 		group_by = <group>			  # How the equipment is grouped in the production screen
# 		interface_category = <type>	 # Which category the equipment appears in the production screen
# 		
# 		# Resources used to build this equipment
# 		resources = {
# 			<resource> = <amount>
# 		}
# 		
# 		# Modifiers the equipment uses
# 		<modifiers> 
# 	}
# }
# 
# Regular equipment follows the following format:
# 
# equipments = {
#     <equipment> = {
#         year = <int>        # Limits the equipment from appearing before the specified year. Optional
#         
#         active = yes            # Determines if this equipment is available without unlocking from a technology.
#         
#         archetype = <equipment> # Which archetype equipment this equipment inherits from.
#         parent = <equipment>    # Which equipment is parent to this equipment (i.e. which does it supercede)
#         priority = <int>        # Priority for usage over other equipment.
#         visual_level = <int>    # Image priority in production screen
#         
#         # Resources used to build this equipment
#         resources = {
#             <resource> = <amount>
#         }

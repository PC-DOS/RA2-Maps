#  Province modifiers apply a modifier to a specific province rather than a state. They can be applied via the add_province_modifier effect, and removed with remove_province_modifier. More info on how to use these can be seen in the effects page.
# An example definition looks like
# 
# mod_modifier = { 
#     army_speed_factor = -0.5
#     army_defence_factor = 0.5
#     dig_in_speed_factor = 0.5
# }
# 
# Many state-scope modifiers will work in province scope as well. In order to make the GFX in GUI, you first need to edit /Hearts of Iron IV/interface/countrystateview.gui. The icon must be defined inside custom_icon_container, similarly to other examples. An example definition looks like
# 
# iconType = {
#     name = "<modifier name>_icon"
#     spriteType = "GFX_modifiers_<modifier name>_icon"
#     position = { x = 0 y = 0 }
#     Orientation = "UPPER_LEFT"			
# }
# 
# The spriteType you have defined needs to be defined in /Hearts of Iron IV/interface/*.gfx similarly to this example:
# 
# spriteType = {
#     name = "GFX_modifiers_<modifier name>_icon"
#     textureFile = "gfx/interface/modifiers_<modifier name>_icon.dds"
# }

# AI peace since 1.12
# The peace conference behaviour for AI is defined within /Hearts of Iron IV/common/peace_conference/ai_peace/*.txt files.
# 
# When defining the peace conference AI that would be used by the country, the AI will take into account all blocks for which the enable condition is true.
# 
# When evaluating the peace conference, ROOT (the default scope) is used to represent the currently-evaluated winner, FROM is the country which will undergo the selected peace action, this can be a previously non-existent country that will now be liberated or puppeted, or even a different winner country when liberating, finally FROM.FROM.FROM can be used to set conditions on the specific state that the peace action is taken on.
# 
# The enable = { ... } trigger block is used to determine whether the AI should be enabled, and finally an ai_desire = ... block determines the priority of the defined strategy: a value of -1000 would make AI never pursue the selected peace action if the conditions are met, while a value of 1000 would make the action their top priority.
# 
# The following peace options are used in the game:
# 
#     liberate - The country FROM gets liberated by ROOT.
#     puppet - The country FROM gets puppeted by ROOT.
#     take_states - The state FROM.FROM.FROM, previously owned by FROM, gets annexed by ROOT.
#     force_government - The country FROM gets its ideology forcefully changed by ROOT.
# 
# When evaluating peace conferences, the controller of a given state is the same one that occupied it before the start of the conference while the owner is the original owner.
# Example:
# 
# peace_ai_desires = {
#     dont_puppet_warlord_countries = {
#         peace_action_type = { puppet liberate force_government }    #all but take states
#         enable = {
#             FROM = {
#                 OR = {
#                     tag = SIK
#                     tag = PRC
#                     tag = GXC
#                     tag = YUN
#                     tag = SHX
#                     tag = XSM
#                     tag = MAN
#                     tag = MEN
#                 }
#             }
#         }
#         ai_desire = -1000
#     }
# }

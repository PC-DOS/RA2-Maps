# 
# The peace conference behaviour for AI is defined within /Hearts of Iron IV/common/ai_peace/*.txt files.
# 
# When defining the peace conference AI that would be used by the country, the game picks the first-defined one that meets the prerequisites. In this case, files are loaded sorted by their filename using ASCII character IDs.
# 
# When evaluating the peace conference, ROOT (the default scope) is used to represent the currently-evaluated winner and FROM is used to represent the currently-evaluated loser. Additionally, the following temporary variables exist within:
# 
#     taken_states@TAG is an array of states that are annexed by the country TAG as a part of the peace conference.
#     taken_by@123 is the country that took the specified state, in this case 123.
#     current_states@TAG is an array of states that aren't decided upon yet in the peace conference and are under the control of TAG that lost the war.
#     subject_states@TAG is an array of states that are, within the peace conference, set to be transferred to countries that are subjected by TAG.
#     subject_countries@TAG is an array of countries that are, within the peace conference, set to be subjected by TAG.
#     subjected_by@123 is the overlord of the country that is set to have the specified state in the peace conference, in this case 123.
#     subjected_by@TAG is an array of countries that have TAG as their overlord.
#     liberate_states@TAG is an array of states that are going to countries that have been liberated by TAG.
#     liberate_countries@TAG is an array of countries that have been liberated by TAG.
# 
# The enable = { ... } trigger block is used to determine whether the AI should be enabled. If true and no other previously-loaded peace conference AI is true, this AI will be chosen.
# 
# There are the following peace options that are used in the game:
# 
#     annex - The country FROM gets entirely annexed by ROOT. This only evaluates the countries.
#     liberate - The country FROM gets liberated by ROOT.
#     puppet - The country FROM gets puppeted by ROOT.
#     puppet_all - The country FROM gets puppeted by ROOT and is able to retain all of its states.
#     puppet_state - The state ROOT gets transferred to FROM.FROM, which became a subject of FROM within the peace conference.
#     take_states - The state FROM gets annexed by ROOT.
#     force_government - The country FROM gets its ideology forcefully changed by ROOT.
# 
# When evaluating peace conferences, the controller of a given state is the same one that occupied it before the start of the conference while the owner is the original owner.
# 
# Each peace conference option is a MTTH block within the file's definition.
# Example:
# 
# my_peace_conference = {
#     enable = {
#         has_government = my_ideology_group
#     }
